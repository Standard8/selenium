Version number notation guide: 
The version number of the IEDriverServer.exe is in the pattern as follows:

  major.minor.build.revision

The "major" and "minor" fields are synchronized to releases of the Selenium
project. Changes in the "build" field indicate interim releases made publicly
available via the project downloads page. Changes in "revision" field indicate
private releases checked into the prebuilts directory of the source tree, but
not made generally available on the downloads page.

v2.33.0.1
=========
 * Refactored session shutdown code to properly wait for thread termination.
   Fixes issue #5543.

v2.33.0.0
=========
 * Release to synchronize with release of Selenium project.

v2.32.3.13
==========
 * Modified to better detect focus on incorrect UI elements when
   requireWindowFocus is specified.

v2.32.3.12
==========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Prevent double-clicks when using WebElement.click(). When using the 
   requireWindowFocus capability, it's possible that multiple calls to 
   WebElement.click() might happen too quickly, and they might be interpreted
   as a double-click. This change inspects the last time an element was clicked
   on, and if it is within the system double-click time, it waits until that
   time passes before performing the second click.
 * Made InputManager more robust in the requireWindowFocus case. Previously, 
   using the Windows SendInput API could cause keystrokes and mouse events to
   be added to the system message queue, but would return back to the caller
   before those events were processed by Internet Explorer's message loop.
   This change adds a Windows mouse hook and keyboard hook to monitor when
   the messages are processed by an applications message loop. There is still a
   potential race condition, and users may still need to execute some local
   synchronization code.

v2.32.3.11
==========
 * Refactored IE driver element click code to all use InputManager class. 
   Previously, WebElement.click() used a different code path than the Advanced
   User Interactions API. These code paths are now unified for the native
   events case.

v2.32.3.10
==========
 * Reinstated separate-thread execution of JavaScript on Windows 8. This
   functionality had been disabled in 2.26.1.2, because of crashes in the IE
   driver on Windows 8. It seems likely that the COM object lifetime cleanup
   that happened in 2.31.0.2 corrected these problems. There is a possibililty,
   however, that the root cause of the Windows 8 crashes is still in place. If
   that is the case, this change should be rolled back.

v2.32.3.9
=========
 * Modified to check the editable state of an element before clearing.
   The clear Automation Atom normally checks that an element is interactable
   and editable before attempting to clear it. A previous change fixed the case
   for checking the interactable state, but not the editable state. The driver
   will now check the editable state as well. To facilitate this, a new atom
   has been exposed for checking the editable state.

v2.32.3.8
=========
 * Modified to check the interactable state of an element before clearing.
   The clear Automation Atom normally checks that an element is interactable
   before attempting to clear it. Unfortunately, when the atom is run on a
   separate thread in legacy IE, the error states do not get propagated back to
   the calling thread properly. To avoid this problem, the driver will check
   the interactable state before calling the clear atom. To facilitate this, a
   new atom has been exposed for checking the interactable state.

v2.32.3.7
=========
 * Increased timeout for asynchronous JavaScript execution. This allows more
   time for automation atoms to complete their operations before timing out.
 * Modified to throw if an element is not enclosed within a form in IE.

v2.32.3.6
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Refactoring asynchronous execution of JavaScript in IE driver. This
   introduces a new method for executing JavaScript functions asynchronously
   via a new thread. This centralizes the code used to execute automation atoms
   that may cause an alert to display (like click or submit or clear). Fixes
   issue #5556.

v2.32.3.5
=========
 * Corrected logic error in implementing loop. The code was intended to use a
   loop, but instead used a simple if statement.

v2.32.3.4
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Added retry loop for handling alerts on shutdown. Previously the IE session
   would only check twice for alerts on shutdown. This handles the case of
   repeated alerts, and will check up to six times, for a total of 30 seconds.

v2.32.3.3
=========
 * Corrected dismissal of dialogs on browser quit. The IESession object already
   had code to check that the IECommandExecutor had fully quit before shutting
   down the thread on which the executor was running. However, it had no code
   to handle the case where all browser instances for that session were not
   properly shut down. Now the session will ask the executor to check one final
   time and make one last-ditch effort to dismiss any dialogs and shut down
   the browser instances. Please note that the best practice is to handle any
   alerts that may appear in web pages being automated before executing
   driver.quit(); this should only be used as a last resort.

v2.32.3.2
=========
 * Corrected dismissal of onBeforeUnload dialogs. We now notify the button's
   immediate parent, instead of sending a message to the button. Sending the
   BM_CLICK message to the button can fail if the dialog doesn't have the 
   system focus.

v2.32.3.1
=========
 * Corrected logic error in alert handling. A slight logic error in the alert
   handling code was causing the alert handling to not wait for the alert to be
   completely dismissed before continuing. This was causing a race condition
   that could lead to crashes when quitting the browser if certain types of
   alerts were active. Fixes issue #5489.

v2.32.3.0
=========
 * Corrected number of script arguments in InputManager::SendKeystrokes. In a
   recent refactor, this code was slightly changed, and the declaration of a
   Script object was expecting three arguments instead of the required four.
   Fixes issue #5502.

v2.32.2.0
=========
 * Corrected logic error in reading TabProcGrowth registry value. The
   TabProcGrowth registry value can be a DWORD or a string. If it is a string,
   it can be a numeric string (e.g., "0"), and still be treated by Internet
   Explorer as if it were an actual numeric value. This change to
   BrowserFactory::GetRegistryValue() correctly handles both cases, coercing
   the value to a string type for comparison.

v2.32.1.0
=========
 * Modified IEDriverServer to take new command-line switches to allow click on
   users to force the use of the Windows CreateProcess API for launching IE.
   For some cases, it may be necessary to launch IE in Private mode for
   testing in parallel on a single node. To support this, there must be a way
   to force the IE driver to use the Windows CreateProcess() API to launch IE
   so that the user can specify command-line switches. To preserve the
   ability to locate the correct process for IE versions 8 and higher, a
   registry value must be set to a specific value, and the IE driver checks for
   the registry value before launching IE. Patch for this fix provided by Alex
   Savchuk.The registry settings are:

     Key: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\InternetExplorer\Main
     Value Name: TabProcGrowth
     Value: "0"

 * Fixed Element::IsAttachedToDom() when used with SVG for IEDriver.
   Patch for this fix provided by Patrick Gansterer.

v2.32.0.1
=========
 * Fixed to allow click on visible portion of element if center point cannot be
   scrolled into view. This fixes issue #4390 for IE. There is still a fix that
   needs to be made for Firefox for the issue to be closed. Patch provided by
   Alex Savchuk.

v2.32.0.0
=========
 * Release to synchronize with release of Selenium project.

v2.31.0.3
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Fixing to no longer allow stale element references to be used in JavaScript
   execution. The driver now checks the return value when recursively walking
   JavaScript arrays and objects. Fixes issue #4769. Patch provided by Alex
   Savchuk.

v2.31.0.2
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Refactored IE element finder to make clearer when Sizzle is used.
   Previously, it was not as easy to determine from IEDriverServer.exe logs
   when Sizzle was being used for finding elements by CSS selector. It is now
   explicitly called out and logged. Also, automation atoms are being used when
   Sizzle is not necessary.
 * Simplified COM object handling code in IE driver. COM objects are now
   correctly referenced everywhere via smart pointers, and use of some aliased
   types is now replaced by the C++ primitives.

v2.31.0.1
=========
 * Added ability to get current URL from IWebBrowser2 if IHTMLDocument2 fails.
   Under normal circumstances, the IE driver gets the current URL from the
   document loaded in the browser. When IE browses to a non-HTML page, such as
   a PDF file with the Adobe Reader plugin installed, getting the document
   fails, since there is no "document" in the browser. In that case, fall back
   to getting the LocationURL property of the IWebBrowser2 interface. It's
   arguable that this is the wrong thing to do, since the driver is useless
   without an actual document, but we'll let this work anyway. Fixes issue
   #5361.
 * Updated logic in IE driver to correctly wait for the document. Fixes issue
   #5326.
 * Submit should throw NoSuchElementException if the target element is not
   within a form. Implemented in atoms, Firefox and HtmlUnit.
 * Reinstated execution of JavaScript on separate thread for IE10 on Windows 7.
 * Removed use of CComQIPtr from IE driver native code. The use of CComQIPtr is
   not needed, as we are substituting a call to the QueryInterface method
   instead. This is what CComQIPtr does under the covers anyway.

v2.31.0.0
=========
 * Release to synchronize with release of Selenium project.

v2.30.2.3
=========
 * Introduced "browserAttachTimeout" capability. This allows the user to set a
   capability to control how long the IE driver will attempt to locate an IE
   browser window belonging to the iexplore.exe process launched by the driver.
   This is to overcome the bug reported by some users that the IELaunchURL
   Windows API reports the incorrect process ID for the launched iexplore.exe
   process. In this case, there is nothing the IE driver can do about the
   problem as the bug is inside IE itself. However, this will allow a user
   to exit the offending situation early, and attempt to recover. The 
   capability expects an integer value, representing the number of milliseconds
   the driver will contininue to look for the newly-launched IE window. Setting
   the capability to 0 (which is its default value) will cause the IE driver to
   wait indefinitely. Fixes issue #4541.

v2.30.2.2
=========
 * Fixed issues found via static code analysis.

v2.30.2.1
=========
 * Simplified element scroll calculation code by using the new
   isInParentOverflow atom.

v2.30.2.0
=========
 * Hacked around the case where McAfee SiteAdvisor is installed as a plugin for
   IE. Modal dialogs are now checked for existence of the WS_CAPTION style.
   Note that if IE ever decides to change how it displays alerts, this may
   begin to cause failures in alert detection. Fixes issue #4839.

v2.30.1.0
=========
 * Updates to version resources. No functional changes.

v2.30.0.0
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Fixed incorrect JSON return values for findElements when an error occurs.
   This is a "best-faith" effort at resolving reports of NullPointerExceptions
   in Java. If future occurrances of the symptoms are found, please open a new
   issue. Fixes issue #3800.

v2.29.1.2
=========
 * Fixed auto-release of modifier keys when using element.SendKeys with 
   requireWindowFocus capability. 

v2.29.1.1
=========
 * Enabled synthetic events mouse clicks to work even when the click triggers
   a JavaScript alert. 

v2.29.1.0
=========
 * Updated to use correct parameter in message loop for executing asynchronous
   JavaScript. Fixes issue #5137.

v2.29.0.4
=========
 * Allowed the IE driver to get the text of a prompt() dialog window. Fixes
   issue #4594.

v2.29.0.3
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Removed checking for element visibility and non-zero size from method used
   for scrolling elements into view and getting their location.
 * Fixed unexpected occurrences of UnhandledAlertException after closing modal
   dialogs created using showModalDialog().

v2.29.0.2
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Modified method for checking whether modifier keys should be automatically
   released when calling sendKeys, either from an element or from the actions
   class.

v2.29.0.1
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Modified findElement implementations to fail without waiting for the
   implicit wait timeout to expire if finding on a closed window. Fixes issue
   #5057.

v2.29.0.0
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Dampened excessive noise in IE driver logging.
 * Modified to initialize value_ member of Response to Json::Value::null upon
   creation.
 * Updated IEDriverServer.exe to correctly return the current version in the 
   JSON response for the /status end point of the JSON wire protocol.
 * Added usage info to IEDriverServer.exe when using /? /h or /help.
 * Removed dead code from ScreenshotCommandHandler.

v2.28.0.4
=========
 * Initialized value_ member of Response to Json::Value::null upon creation.
 * Suppressed warnings written to console during browser startup and shutdown.
 * Updated to correctly return the current version in the JSON response for the
   /status end point of the JSON wire protocol.
 * Added usage info to IEDriverServer.exe when using /? /h or /help. Also
   removed dead code from ScreenshotCommandHandler.

v2.28.0.3
=========
 * Introduced the "requireWindowFocus" capability into the IE driver. When used
   in conjunction with the "nativeEvents" capability, the driver will attempt 
   to bring the current IE window to the foreground before executing a mouse
   or keyboard event. Also, when the requireWindowFocus capability is set to
   true, advanced user interactions will now use the Windows SendInput() API to
   execute the interactions. To enable this behavior, set the value of the
   requiresWindowFocus capability to "true" when creating an instance of the IE
   driver. The default for this new capability is "false". This functionality
   is currently considered extremely experimental; use at your own risk.

v2.28.0.2
=========
 * Changed view port calculations to allow for always-present vertical scroll
   bar, and to test for horizontal scroll bar and adjust as required by page
   content. Fixes issue #3602.
 * Changed IE GetLocationOnceScrolledIntoView behavior to take the 2-pixel
   border of the <html> element used by IE7 and below (and document modes that
   emulate that).
 * Extracted map of managed elements in IE driver to ElementRepository class.
   First step in a potentially larger refactor.

v2.28.0.1
=========
 * Attempted to change coordinate calculations due to frame offsets to handle
   the cross-domain frame case. This change rests on the assumption that the
   order of frames returned by the JavaScript document.frames collection is
   the same as that returned by document.getElementByTagName("frame") or
   document.getElementByTagName("iframe"). Fixes issue #4948.

v2.28.0.0
=========
 * Changed the shared WebDriver C++ server component to use strings in
   serialized commands instead of integers. Testing does not seem to indicate
   this will introduce a performance issue, and it makes logs more intelligible
   when logging the raw JSON of a received command. As far as anyone can
   determine, the only consumer of this component is the IEDriverServer.exe, so
   this should be a completely internal change.

v2.27.0.0
=========
 * Release to coincide with full Selenium release.

v2.26.3.0
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Define document on goog.global for fragments, as the closure library now
   depends on it. Fixes issue #4802.

v2.26.2.6
=========
 * Fixed SendKeysCommandHandler to check that the focus is in the HTML display
   pane, and not some other UI element (like the address bar) before sending
   the keystrokes.

v2.26.2.5
=========
 * Added new capability "enableElementCacheCleanup". When set to true, the
   IE driver will clean the known-element cache of invalid elements after
   every page load. This is intended to keep memory usage down and improve
   performance. However, it is an intrusive change, so this capability is
   provided temporarily to allow disabling this behavior if problems arise.
   The default of this new capability is "true", meaning this behavior is
   turned on by default.
 * Refactored IE driver Element class to contain IsAttachedToDom() method,
   and IECommandHandler::GetElement() to use it.
 * Modified to avoid logging the tag name of the element if getting the tag
   name fails in the IE driver. Fixes issue #4811.

v2.26.2.4
=========
 * Corrected fix to issue #4800 to better handle nested frames.
 * Refactored native code to return the location of each frame containing an
   element.
 * Refactored location methods of native IE driver code to take a LocationInfo
   struct instead of separate args for x, y, width and height.

v2.26.2.3
=========
 * On behalf of AdamWu: Fixed calculation of coordinates for elements in 
   frames/iframes where the element is scrolled out of view within the frame.
   Fixes issue #4800.

v2.26.2.2
=========
 * Disabled execution of JavaScript code on a separate thread for IE10. This
   reverts the behavior of the driver to that before 2.26.1.0 for IE10 *only*.
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.

v2.26.2.1
=========
 * Modified to return ENOSUCHDRIVER if a session is not available.

v2.26.2.0
=========
 * Fixed synchronization issues. These issues were always present, but never
   manifested until the IE driver was used with IE 10.
 * Reinstating functionality to run JavaScript on a separate thread on Windows
   8.

v2.26.1.2
=========
 * Removed functionality to run JavaScript on a separate thread on Windows 8.

v2.26.1.1
=========
 * Attempted to resolve crash on Windows 8 introduced by JavaScript execution
   on a separate thread. Added checks for proper interface marshaling on the
   worker thread.

v2.26.1.0
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Modified to no longer hang on alerts triggered by onchange of <select>
   elements or by onsubmit of <form> elements. Fixes issue #3508. Fixes 
   issue #2103.

v2.26.0.9
=========
 * Modified scroll behavior in IE driver SendKeysCommandHandler to call 
   Element::GetLocationOnceScrolledIntoView() instead of calling the DOM 
   scrollIntoView() function. Fixes issue #4393.
 * Modified to not call blur() on focusing element if the active element is
   the <body> element. This should no longer cause the IE window to drop to
   the bottom of the Z-order. Fixes issue #2353 and related.

v2.26.0.8
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Release to coincide with full Selenium release.

v2.26.0.7
=========
 * Modified so that closing a window (or quitting a browser) now sets the 
   focused frame to NULL, as if switchTo().defaultContent() had been called.
   This is to prevent crashes of the executable when quitting the driver. Fixes
   issue #4178.

v2.26.0.6
=========
 * Added use of a mutex when creating a session. This should allow multiple
   threads to create and use different instances of IEDriverServer.exe,
   enabling multiple instances under most language bindings.
 * Added enablePersistentHover capability to allow users to turn off persistent
   mouse hover within the IE driver.

v2.26.0.5
=========
 * Refactored alert handling to allow handling of OnBeforeUnload dialogs. This
   is a slightly incomplete solution, as the dialog is not automatically
   handled on window close/browser exit. To work around this limitation,
   navigate to a different page (handling the OnBeforeUnload dialog), then
   call the quit() method.

v2.26.0.4
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.

v2.26.0.3
=========
 * Allowed buttons on alerts with control IDs of IDRETRY to be handled as 
   "OK" buttons, which should allow them to be handled by Alert.accept().

v2.26.0.2
=========
 * Modified find-by-XPath code to correctly escape embedded quotes before
   invoking the findElement atom.

v2.26.0.1
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Updated to use Wicked Good XPath (http://code.google.com/p/wicked-good-xpath)
   as the XPath engine for the IE driver.

v2.26.0.0
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.

v2.25.3.6
=========
 * Modified behavior such that sending a Quit command on a non-existent
   session is now a no-op, and does not return an error code.

v2.25.3.5
=========
 * Added command-line switch to control to where the IEDriver.dll is extracted.
   Not specifying the switch causes the file to be extracted to the temp 
   directory.

v2.25.3.4
=========
 * Corrected searching for alert windows from windows opened by 
   showModalDialog().

v2.25.3.3
=========
 * Implemented "silent" command-line switch on IEDriverServer.exe to suppress
   printing to console of initial diagnostic information.

v2.25.3.2
=========
 * Implemented check in GetCurrentWindowHandleCommandHandler to verify that
   window handle is a valid window, returning a NoSuchWindowException if it
   is not. This was originally broken in r17651.

v2.25.3.1
=========
 * Implemented checks to ensure alerts are completely dismissed by IE before
   continuing to the next command.

v2.25.3.0
=========
 * Implemented automatic dismissal of alerts, settable by capability.
 * Implemented navigation back and forward through browser history on a
   separate thread, so as to no longer hang on alerts.

v2.25.2.3
=========
 * Fixed the case verifying whether a page in the browser is an HTML page, and
   the default browser does not register its MIME type in the (default) value
   at HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\<browser HTML page class name>. Fixes issue #4307.

v2.25.2.2
=========
 * Increased logging when getting registry values.
 * Fixed spacing in log messages 

v2.25.2.1
=========
 * Updated to return ENOSUCHWINDOW if trying to switch to a window ID that does
   not exist.

v2.25.2.0
=========
 * Fixed IE6 case for checking browser zoom level.
 * Now repeatedly sending WM_MOUSEMOVE messages on a separate thread to try to
   quell mouse hover issues.

v2.25.1.0
=========
 * Added error checking for zoom level for IE. The IE driver will now throw an
   exception if the zoom level isn't 100%. This behavior can be disabled in the
   IE driver by setting the "ignoreZoomLevel" capability. Fixes Issue #4272.
 * Stop execution when a call to IWebBrowser2::Navigate2() fails in the IE
   driver. This prevents a hang when we weren't checking for an error
   condition. Fixes issue #4279.

v2.25.0.0
=========
 * Handle quirky handling of mime types if Firefox was ever the default browser
   on a Windows installation, but now a different (non-IE) browser has stepped
   into that role.
 * Increased timeout for finding file upload dialog in uploading file. Fixes
   issue #3858.
 * Updated initialization of variables in MouseMoveToCommandHandler.h and in
   GetElementLocationOnceScrolledIntoViewCommandHandler.h. Fixes issue #4205.
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Release to coincide with full Selenium release.

v2.24.2.0
=========
 * Refactoring command line argument handling in IEDriverServer.exe, now that
   the number of valid arguments is growing.
 * Added ability to control log level and log file via command line switches to
   IEDriverServer.exe (on behalf of AlexandrSavchuk).
 * Re-added else-if for GetSessionList command inadvertently removed in r15345.
   Fixes issue #4160.
 * Added logging message to a large portion of the IE driver (on behalf of 
   AlexandrSavchuk). Set the log file with

       --log-file="C:\full\path\to\filename.log"

   (default is to log to the console). Set the logging level with

       --log-level=LOGLEVEL

   where LOGLEVEL is one of TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, or FATAL (default
   is FATAL). Fixes issue #4159

v2.24.1.0
=========
 * Added elementScrollBehavior capability to allow users to specify how
   elements scroll into the viewport for interaction. Default behavior is
   unchanged (the capability is set to 0), but can be set to scroll to align
   to the bottom of the viewport by setting the capability to 1.
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.

v2.24.0.0
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Release to coincide with full Selenium release.

v2.23.2.0
=========
 * Crash prevention for when there is no "current" browser window, like when
   the current window is closed without the user switching to another window.
   Fixes issue #4071.

v2.23.1.1
=========
 * Crash prevention for when IWebBrowser2::get_Document() returns S_FALSE.
   Fixes issue #4064.

v2.23.1.0
=========
 * Updated error messaging for certain conditions of Element.Click()

v2.23.0.0
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.
 * Release to coincide with full Selenium release.

v2.22.1.1
=========
 * Updates to JavaScript automation atoms.

v2.22.1.0
=========
 * Re-enabling native code driver to understand "nativeEvents" capability.
   This was disabled due to CI-build restrictions which have now been resolved.

v2.22.0.0
=========
 * Initial release required by client language bindings.
